## Overview

*This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.* (extract from subject)

## TO DO
- Add performance report
- Add visualisation GIF
- Add Explanation of algorithm.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BWG31/push_swap
2. Compile the executable:
    ```sh
    make
## Usage
 - The provided array of numbers represents stack A, with the start of the array representing the top of the stack.
 - The numbers must be unique and within the range of [INT_MIN ... INT_MAX].
 - Standard use:
    ```sh
    ./push_swap <array of numbers to sort>
    # Will output a set of instructions to sort the stack
 - Use with checker:
    ```sh
    ARG="<array of numbers to sort>"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
    # Will display 'OK' if successful and 'KO' if unsuccessful.
  - The checker will read from the STD input and check if the commands correctly sort the stack provided as argument(s).
